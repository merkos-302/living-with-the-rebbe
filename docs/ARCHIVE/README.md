# Archived Documentation

These documents contain the original detailed planning for the Living with the Rebbe project. They have been superseded by the simplified documentation in the main directory.

## Archived Files

- **MVP_PLAN.md** - Original detailed MVP planning (before consolidation)
- **WEEK_1_SPRINT.md** - Day-by-day sprint plan (now in MVP_SCOPE.md)
- **DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md** - Verbose development guide (see QUICKSTART.md instead)
- **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** - Detailed deployment steps (see DEPLOYMENT.md instead)
- **TESTING_PLAN.md** - Comprehensive test planning (integrated into MVP_SCOPE.md)

## Why Archived?

These documents contained:
- Redundant information repeated across multiple files
- Resolved issues and questions
- Outdated scope (400 newsletters vs current 3 + weekly)
- Excessive detail that obscured key information

The current documentation is streamlined and focuses on what developers need to know to build the MVP.
